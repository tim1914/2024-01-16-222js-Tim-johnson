# Bonus for Chapter 3

## Perform calculation

1. Create a new file in your WIP directory sto write code to calculate BMI (Body Mass Index) by storing data in variables and using the given formula.

   Calculation: [weight (lb) / height (in) / height (in)] x 703

   Examples with input and answers: https://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpao/growthcharts/training/bmiage/page5_2.html

## Setup jschallenges

1. Create a subdirectory in your WIP called: `jschallenges`

1. In this directory create a file called `introduction.js`.

1. Now, open a command prompt (not within VS Code) at any location. Maximize this window.

1. Execute this command, we will talk more about its meaning later:
   `npm install -g javascripting`

1. Now execute the following command:
   `javascripting`

1. The CLI screen will present a list of challenges to you. Choose the first one and ignore the bits about creating a directory, you will do your work in VS Code in the jschallenges folder you have just created. Skip to the first part which says to add this to introduction.js:

   ```javascript
   console.log("hello");
   ```

1. Right click on your `introduction.js` file to open to a terminal at this path.

1. Note the command below that the program says to use to verify your work. This is how you will check your work for future challenges.

   ```
   javascripting verify introduction.js
   ```

1. Read the output. If your code passes, go on to the next challenge by returning to the command prompt and hitting the up arrow to get to the menu again.

1. Complete all challenges during the week.
