1. Run and examine output. It should work for this new object as well.
 
1. Mark your work as complete (online spreadsheet or in-class name tent card) then work on bonuses.

## Bonus

Create another function called printNameBackwards. Write the logic to reverse name. Use MDN docs on String functions. Recall String is an array of characters.
