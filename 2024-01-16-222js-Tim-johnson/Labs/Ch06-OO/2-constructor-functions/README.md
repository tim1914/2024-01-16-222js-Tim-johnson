1. Improve the formatting by updating the constructor function to include a new function called **displayTitleAuthor**. Notice in the red box below the content of the function and where to put it. Pay special attention to the syntax.

## Bonus

1. Call constructor function without calling new. What happens? Refer to slides and prevent from calling constructor function without new.
